<p> <a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. It has been a private liberal arts university for over 150 years. Trinity currently has over two thousand students enrolled, with 74% of the students living on campus. Education at Trinity focuses on preparing students with critical thinking, decision making, and communication skills through various subjects and academics.</p>


<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are its amazing professors, who you can develop close relationships with because of the small class sizes. The advanced technology, beautiful architecture, and magnificent library stand out to me the most.</p>

<p>I chose Trinity because when I visited the campus, I felt like I fit in very comfortably. Both of my siblings are Trinity alumni, so the campus already feels somewhat familiar to me. Nevertheless, the transition into college classes and lifestyle has been an overwhelmingly exciting and new process. The campus size is perfect for me, the buildings are beautiful, and San Antonio is a great location.</p>

<p>I am currently studying at Trinity to become an English major because of my interest in writing and studying literature. I will also likely pursue a double major or a minor in Classics. I want to graduate within four years to get my BA. In the future, I'd be excited to pursue any career that allows me to write and communicate with others. Hopefully, I can learn the best ways to tell powerful, meaningful stories through words.</p>
